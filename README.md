# Telitype

A terminal typing game prototype. Currently a work in progress. 

This project takes inspiration from the [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) tutorial.

## How to build:
From the *src* directory, run:

```
make
```

Once completed, a *telitype* executable will be added to the *src* directory.

Run the command:

```
telitype ../test/the-great-gatsby.txt
```

for testing.
